# lemad
**Install** 

To install the R package LEMAD, type from R (Rstudio):

```
library(devtools)
remotes::install_github("leonelhalsina/lemad")
```
It is likely that the latest Rtools should be installed.
We recommend to have the latest R (it works perfectly with R 4.2.1).
Also, package rgal might cause issues.

**Using Lemad**

We have prepared a vignette (a sort of manual with chunks of code) that can
be called once you load the library:

```
library(lemad)
browseVignettes("lemad")
```
